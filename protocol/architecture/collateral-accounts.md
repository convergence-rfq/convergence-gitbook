# Collateral Accounts

## Create Account

Both makers and takers can create collateral accounts within their wallets. The collateral accounts can be created using a standard smart contract interface, and they can be customized to meet the specific needs of the user. When creating a collateral account, users must specify the amount of collateral they wish to deposit.

## Deposit Funds

After creating a collateral account, users can deposit USDC into the account. This USDC serves as collateral for their trades and is used to cover any losses that may occur during the settlement process. Depositing funds into a collateral account is typically done through a USDC transfer to the smart contract associated with the account. Once the deposit is confirmed on the blockchain, the funds will be credited to the user's collateral account.

## Withdraw Funds

Users can also withdraw USDC from their collateral accounts. This can be done at any time, as long as the withdrawal does not cause the collateral balance to drop below the required minimum for open trades. Withdrawals are typically initiated through a withdrawal request to the smart contract associated with the collateral account. Once the withdrawal request is confirmed on the blockchain, the funds will be transferred back to the user's wallet.
