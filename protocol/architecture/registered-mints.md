# Registered Mints

Registered mints are specific token mints that have been registered with the protocol. They are associated with a base asset and are used to represent a specific instance of that asset on the blockchain. By registering mints with the protocol, the platform can ensure that trades are settled in a secure and efficient manner, with the correct collateral being held in the appropriate collateral accounts.
