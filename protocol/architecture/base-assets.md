# Base Assets

Base assets are token abstractions that are associated with a price oracle and identified by a ticker symbol. They represent a specific token or group of tokens that can be traded on the Convergence platform. Base assets can be enabled or disabled by the protocol depending on market conditions or other factors. When creating an RFQ request or response, the base asset is used to calculate the required collateral and ensure that the trade is properly collateralized.
